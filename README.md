# Stage One - Parsing and Recording
When I started out, I knew the two halves of this task would be going from text to data usable by my visualizer and going from that data to an image.
Once I researched "Genbank Python", I quickly found Biopython.

# Stage Two - Visualizing
There were easy to find visualization tools for Python, but it was harder to find Circos, that does specifically circles.
I found Circos when I found Circular-genome-visualizer, an entire project that was similar to what you wanted us to implement, which I found by searching "Python Genbank visualize".
